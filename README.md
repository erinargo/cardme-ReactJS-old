# This is the backend, an Express NodeJS Server
This project is almost out of Beta, but, it is not yet finished. There are a few features
I would like to alter and a few I'd like to add. 
I need to re-do some of the backend code
and clean it up. However, 
I will leave it as is for now as I feel it is read to launch.

I have not commented any of the code. 
I have not made any of it super legible. 

I do want to fix this and am currently working on it in my free time. However,
the project itself will be launching regardless.

To run, open a console in this directory and do ```node app.js```
If you are linux you will need to run as root.

# TODO: (Ignore if you're not Erin)
Comment. All. Of. This. Code.
